# How It Works???
Health Monitoring: The collar belt device continuously monitors the dog's vital signs, including heart rate, temperature, and activity levels. This data is collected in real-time and transmitted to the companion mobile app for analysis.

Distress Detection: The device is equipped with sensors that detect signs of distress or unusual behavior in the dog, such as excessive barking, whimpering, or abnormal movements. When distress signals are detected, the device sends an alert to the mobile app.

Location Tracking: Integrated GPS technology allows the device to provide accurate location tracking of the dog. This enables pet owners and volunteers to quickly locate the dog in case it wanders off or gets lost.

Emergency Alerts: In case of emergencies, such as the dog being in danger or experiencing health issues, the device sends immediate alerts to the companion mobile app. These alerts include information about the dog's current location and the nature of the emergency.

Two-way Communication: The collar belt device features two-way communication capabilities, allowing pet owners to communicate with their dog remotely through the mobile app. This can help calm the dog in stressful situations or provide reassurance when needed.
